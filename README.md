# Atari-Space-Invaders
A software patterns and teams project to replicated the Atari game Space Invaders

Another Atari inspired game follows the format of the classic Space invader game redefined to be set under the sea!  Save your fellow crustaceans from a bombardment of bombs and other attacks from the creatures above!  Survive as long as possible and accumulate as much score as you can before the invading sea creatures get the better of you..

The controls are as follows:

Left: A
Right: D
Up: W
Down: S
Shoot: Space
Quit: Esc

Be safe out there, because sometimes, the water isn't as fine as it seems
